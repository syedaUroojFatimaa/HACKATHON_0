## Rules

1. **Always log important actions.**
   Record every meaningful action taken (task creation, completion, errors) in `Logs/System_Log.md`.

2. **Never take destructive actions without confirmation.**
   Before deleting, overwriting, or permanently modifying any file, ask the user for explicit approval.

3. **Move completed tasks to Done.**
   Once a task is finished, move its file from `Needs_Action/` to `Done/` and update the Dashboard.

4. **Keep task files structured.**
   Every task file should include a clear title, description, status, and date. Use consistent formatting.

5. **If unsure, ask for clarification.**
   Do not guess or assume intent. When a request is ambiguous, ask the user before proceeding.
