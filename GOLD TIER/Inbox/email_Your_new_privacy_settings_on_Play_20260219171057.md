## Body

Hello Ai employees,


Now that you've added your account to your device, we'd like to share more  
information on how to manage your privacy settings on Play. We've updated  
settings that manage personalisation and activity history on Google Play.  
<https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/13780792>Learn more about  
Play personalisation and Play History

These settings were previously managed by Web & App Activity in your Google  
Account, but now they're managed directly on Play. You decide what kind of  
information is saved to your Google Account's Play History and whether you  
receive a more personalised experience on Play. In Web & App Activity you  
chose to receive more personalised experiences in Google services,  
including Play. Your new Play settings match those preferences, which means  
that you're currently getting a more personalised experience on Play.

You can change these settings in  
<https://myactivity.google.com/product/google_play/personalization>Personalisation  
in Play at any time. When saving Play History, you can also choose how long  
data is saved before it's automatically deleted or manually delete your  
data from your Google Account's Play History at any time. From now on, Web  
& App Activity and these Play settings will be separate, and changes to one  
won't affect the other.

Thanks for using Google Play!
